Stock Prediction AI

Overview
Stock Prediction AI is a machine learning project that utilizes LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) models to predict stock prices based on historical data. This project focuses on analyzing the performance of stocks listed in the Nifty 50 index and provides predictions for future price movements.

Features
LSTM Models: The project employs LSTM neural network models, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN), known for their effectiveness in capturing long-term dependencies in sequential data.
Data Processing: Historical stock data for Nifty 50 companies is collected and preprocessed from CSV files. Features such as opening price, closing price, volume, etc., are used for training the models.
Prediction Generation: Trained LSTM models are used to generate predictions for future stock prices. Predictions are saved to CSV files for further analysis and visualization.
Evaluation Metrics: The project includes evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc., to assess the accuracy of the predictions and fine-tune the models.

How to Use
Data Preparation: Ensure that you have the necessary historical stock data in CSV format. The data should include features like opening price, closing price, volume, etc.
Training the Models: Run the provided Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train the LSTM models using the historical stock data. Fine-tune the hyperparameters as needed to improve model performance.
Generating Predictions: Once the models are trained, use them to generate predictions for future stock prices. Save the predictions to CSV files for further analysis.
Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc. Adjust the models and training data as necessary to improve accuracy.
Visualization: Visualize the historical stock data, actual prices, and predicted prices using tools like matplotlib or seaborn to gain insights into the stock price movements.
Development

Python: The project is implemented primarily in Python, making use of libraries such as pandas, numpy, tensorflow/keras, etc., for data manipulation, modeling, and training.
Jupyter Notebook: The provided Jupyter Notebook serves as a central hub for data exploration, model training, prediction generation, and evaluation.
Future Improvements
Model Optimization: Explore advanced techniques such as hyperparameter optimization, feature engineering, and ensemble learning to further improve prediction accuracy.
Incorporating External Factors: Integrate external factors such as economic indicators, news sentiment analysis, etc., to enhance the predictive power of the models.
